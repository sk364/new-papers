## Overview & Motivation

A research paper is a piece of academic writing containing original research results or an interpretation of existing results. The papers, even just the abstract text, are many a times really long and complex to understand, in the first glance. Basically, it's a time-intensive process. While there are softwares which can auto-summarize articles, it still takes a good amount of effort to go through a vast number of articles to find which are related to the paper in question.

This project attempts to solve the problem of sifting through a myriad number of articles to filter the relevant articles for the study, by exposing a web application in which the user can provide an abstract of an article to get a list of related articles.
